## Purpose

This is my second game that I built while learning Unity. It's very simple, but the core game loop is there.

For this game, I learned how particle effects, custom sprites, audio, and game resets work.

Bookmark my page to stay notified of upcoming games as I continue to learn about Unity and game development!

## Credits

The assets and core ideas were given to me as part of the Complete C# Unity Game Developer 2D course on Udemy.
